# Sharkedule

Sharkedule is a free and open source task management tool. Currently, it is in development and is not ready for use.

I'm working on this project in my free time, so it may take a while to get to a usable state. If you want to help, feel
free to fork this repo and submit a pull request.

My goal is to make an open source alternative to Trello, Asana, and other task management tools. Reaching this goal will
take a lot of time and effort, but I think it will be worth it.
